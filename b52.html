			<h1>B-52</h1>
			<p>The B-52 is the longest-serving bomber in U.S. military history. First drafted as
a turboprop-powered replacement for the same company’s B-50 in 1948, the
planned bomber took a change in direction when the 33.36kN (7500lb) thrust
Pratt & Whitney J57 turbojet engine became available. As a consequence of the
appearance of this powerplant, then superior to anything else on offer, Boeing
and the USAF decided to develop a jet-powered strategic bomber. The Boeing
design faced competition from the Convair YB-60, a cheaper jet-powered
alternative that was based on the existing piston-engined B-36 Peacemaker</p>
               <p>Unlike the Sopwith Pup and<em> Triplane</em> that preceded it, the Camel was notablytricky to fly. 
               	It was blessed with power in abundance and its agility was manifest
                in a very tight turning circle. Schemed as a more agile successor to the Pup, the
                Camel was also more powerful and somewhat heavier.</p>
            <h1>Maiden Flight</h1>
            <p>In
the event, the Boeing design promised superior performance to its Convair rival,
and won the day. First to fly was the prototype XB-52, in April 1952. With a
basic design inspired by Boeing’s B-47 Stratojet medium bomber, the new
aircraft featured a slender, high-mounted wing, with eight engines carried in
clustered pairs below and ahead of the leading edge. The ‘bicycle’ undercarriage
was inherited from the Stratojet. Initially, tandem seating was provided for the
pilots. The same configuration was adopted for the second prototype, the YB-52..</p>
            <p>The initial production B-52A first flew in 1954, and three examples were
completed for test and development work by the manufacturer. As a result, the
first model to enter service with the USAF was the B-52B in 1955. Essentially
similar to the B-52A, the B-model added a navigation and bombing system. A
total of 50 B-52Bs were completed, and of these 27 were converted to
reconnaissance standard as the RB-52B.
A major improvement in performance was heralded by the B-52C that also
added various new items of equipment. A total of 35 were built before it was
succeeded by the B-52D, of which 170 were completed. The B-52D differed in
the addition of an improved fire-control system to manage the defensive
armament of four 12.7mm (0.5in) machine guns in the tail. A total of 100 B-
52Es featured a more advanced navigation and weapons delivery system. The B-
52F, meanwhile – of which 89 came off the production line – was an effort to
counter the increasing weight of the basic design. The F-model therefore
featured more powerful J57s, similarly outfitted with water injection to boosttake-off power..</p>
               <h1>Afganistan</h1>
               <p>A B-52H prepares to take on fuel from a tanker during a close-air-support
mission over Afghanistan. The B-52’s contribution to Operation Enduring
Freedom began in 2001, and the bomber has excelled in the close air
support role, thanks to its ability to loiter high above the battlefield for
extended periods and deliver precision-guided munitions in support of the
troops below. Around 10 B-52s were normally in theatre, and these –
together with B-1B Lancers – maintained a constant armed presence during
Enduring Freedom, typically flying missions that lasted from 12 to 15
hours. Depending on the mission profile, the B-52 usually carried a mixed
load of 12 satellite-guided Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) and 27
Mk 82 general-purpose bombs or 16 CBU-103/CBU-87 Wind-Corrected
Munitions Dispensers (WCMDs) and 27 Mk 82s. The CBU-103 was
configured to dispense 202 BLU/97B combined-effects submunitions
accurately against soft area targets from high altitude.</p>
