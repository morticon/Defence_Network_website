			<p>The lead ship of the Kiev-class aircraft-carrying missile
cruisers was laid down at the Chernomorskiy shipyard
in southern Ukraine in 1970, launched in 1972, and
commissioned in December 1975. The Kiev displaced 30,530
tons and was powered by four steam turbines that generated
140,000 shaft horsepower and a top speed of thirty-two knots.
Its aircraft complement totaled up to thirty-two planes and
helicopters, including the Yakovlev Yak-38 vertical takeoff
and landing (VTOL) strike fighter and the Kamov Ka-25 or
Ka-27 antisubmarine helicopters.
The Kiev served as a flagship of the Soviet fleet and
participated in numerous exercises; however, with the decline
and fall of the Soviet Union the ship fell into disrepair and
was decommissioned in 1993. It was eventually sold to Binhai
Aircraft Park in Tianjin, China, and redeveloped as a tourist
attraction and luxury hotel. Three other Kiev-class ships—the
Minsk, Admiral Gorshkov, and Novorossiysk—were completed.</p>
            <h1>Maiden Mission</h1>
            <p>Minsk and Novorossiysk were decommissioned in 1993, and
Admiral Gorshkov was sold to India and renamed Vikramaditya.
One of two intended aircraft-carrying missile cruisers of its
class, the Admiral Kuznetsov is the only operational ship of its
kind in the Russian navy today. She was ordered in the spring
of 1991, laid down at the Black Sea shipyard in Mykolaiv,
Ukraine, in April 1982, and commissioned in December 1990.
Displacing forty-three thousand tons with an overall length
of 1,001 feet and a beam of 236 feet, the carrier is powered
by eight turbo-pressurized boilers and steam turbines that
produce two hundred thousand shaft horsepower and a top
speed of twenty-nine knots.
The Admiral Kuznetsov carries up to fifty-two aircraft,
including the Sukhoi Su-33 air-superiority fighter, the
Mikoyan MiG-29 multipurpose fighter, the Sukhoi Su-25
close air-support plane, and the Kamov Ka-27 helicopter
equipped for multiple roles. Fixed-wing aircraft are launched</p>
            <p>After a first flight in June 1977 the Tu-22M3 entered production, and a total
of 268 examples were completed up to 1993. The final new-build production
version was the Tu-22MR reconnaissance aircraft, around a dozen of which were
manufactured between 1989 and 1993. This is equipped with a side-looking
radar, electronic surveillance measures system, infra-red scanner and cameras.</p>
               <h1>Multi-Role</h1>
               <p>was under construction during the collapse of the Soviet
Union, and the Ukrainian government sold the hull to China,
which in turn completed it and commissioned the carrier
Liaoning. A third ship, Ulyanovsk, was scrapped shortly after
its keel was laid.
For several years, Western observers have noted a growing
Soviet interest in the development of a supercarrier, buteconomic and political uncertainty have terminated such
projects. In the mid-1980s, the Soviets ordered the supercarrier
Ulyanovsk, intended to be the first of its class. Its keel was laid
in November 1988, but three years later the hull was scrapped
at just 20 percent complete and a second carrier was canceled.
With a standard displacement of nearly seventy thousand tons,
overall length of 1,030 feet, and beam of just over 275 feet, the
Ulyanov would have been larger than the US Navy’s Forrestalclass
carriers but still smaller than those of the Nimitz class.
It was projected to carry up to sixty-eight aircraft, including
forty-four Su-33 and MiG-29 fighters, six Yakovlev Yak-44
early-warning aircraft, and eighteen Kamov Ka-27 helicopters.
There are indications that Russian interest in a supercarrier
may have been revived recently, and speculation centers</p>
