			<h1>Asat</h1>
			<p>The SS-1C, known to NATO as the Scud B, was a medium-range surface-to-surface
missile intended for battlefield strikes to hit troop concentrations, defences, depots and
railways up to a distance of 280km. The missile was 11.4m long and could take high
explosive, chemical and nuclear warheads. The rocket was a single-stage missile
employing a liquid propellant. The Scud A and B were initially deployed on tracked
carriers derived from the IS-3 (Joseph Stalin III) heavy tank chassis, but were later
transported on the eight-wheeled MAZ-543. This had eight-wheel-drive, with the front
four wheels steerable, and weighed 28 tons with the missile. The crew compartment
consisted of a heated and air-conditioned cab divided into two by the missile. The original
version was first seen in 1957, and the longer B variant five years later. The SS-1C Scud B
was widely deployed with all the Warsaw Pact armies, as well as in Egypt, Iraq, Libya and
Syria. The Egyptians fired a number at Israeli targets in the Sinai in 1973, but missed.
Around a thousand Scud B missiles were fired at Mujahideen targets in Afghanistan
during the 1980s. The longer-range Scud C and D missiles were largely superseded by the
SS-12 Scaleboard and the short-lived SS-23 Spider.</p>
            <h1>The Elite Club</h1>
            <p>The SS-12 Scaleboard, first reported in 1967, was previously known as the SS-1D Scud C,
but Scaleboard was a much more powerful missile than the Scud. Its range of 800km
made it more of a strategic weapon than one for battlefield support. Scaleboard missiles
deployed in East Germany could have reached much of eastern and south-eastern England.
The SS-12 was very similar in appearance to the earlier SS-1C and employed the same
MAZ-543 chassis as the transporter/launcher, but with a more fully enclosed body behind
the cab. The missile was erected for firing in a similar way but was contained in a ribbed
casing until ready for launch. The longer-range SS-23 Spider was eliminated in the late
1980s under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
</p>
            <p>The SS-15 Scrooge was an even larger intercontinental ballistic missile, measuring 18.3
metres, likewise carried in a tube on the back of a tracked vehicle. While erected in a
similar way to the SS-14, it was fired direct from the tube. Propelled by a solid-fuel
rocket, it could reach up to 5,600km. The carrying vehicles for both the SS-14 and the SS-
15 were very similar, though their missile erecting systems differed. Interestingly, the
running gear was derived from components of the IS-3 heavy tank or its later T-10
derivative.</p>
               <h1>Space Debris</h1>
               <p>The Stiletto, unlike the other nuclear missiles described here, was not mobile, but was a
fourth generation silo-launched liquid-propelled ICBM (supplementing the earlier SS-9,
SS-11, SS-13, SS-17 and SSâ€“18). Alongside the mobile Soviet strategic rocket forces, the
SS-19 was the backbone of the silo-launched missile force. It was initially deployed in the
1970s but was replaced by the upgraded SS-19 Mod 3. This had a storage life of twentytwo
years and was armed with six MIRVs. By 2008 Russia still had 126 operational
missiles, but the mobile SS-25 remained the most numerous ICBM. Clearly Moscow felt
that mobile systems offered a greater deterrence and first strike capability. </p>
