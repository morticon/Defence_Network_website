			<h1>Tu-22M</h1>
			<p>Today, the Tu-22M is in a class of its own: a large, supersonic, continental-range
bomber. Entering production in 1969, the aircraft codenamed ‘Backfire’ in the
West had no design affiliation with the Tu-22 from the same design bureau. By
the time production ended in 1993, a total of more than 500 Tu-22Ms of all
versions had been built, and the type remains in service with the Russian Air
Force. Under a design team led by Andrei Tupolev, work on the future Tu-22M
began in November 1967. Among the specifications for the new bomber were a
maximum speed of up to 2500km/h (1553mph) and a range of 7000km (4349miles) while flying subsonic with a single Kh-22 missile.</p>
               <p>There was no ‘Backfire’ prototype as such, and instead a pre-series batch of
eight Tu-22M0 aircraft were completed, the first of these taking to the air for a
maiden flight in August 1969. However, the bomber proved much slower than
expected, and its range also left much to be desired. Improvements had been
made by July 1971, when the Tu-22M1 was introduced, now with variablegeometry,
in the form of movable outer wing panels. Range and speed were
improved somewhat and the Tu-22M1 was built in small numbers for evaluation
and training.</p>
            <h1>Maiden Flight</h1>
            <p>The first model to enter quantity production was the Tu-22M2 of 1973,
offering a speed of 1700km/h (1056mph) and a range of 5100km (3169 miles).
The various mission systems were also improved. A total of 211 Tu-22M2s
‘Backfire-Bs’ were completed by the time production of this variant ended in
1983. Despite its capabilities, the Tu-22M2 still failed to meet anything like the
original specifications demanded by the military, and in an effort to improve
performance the aircraft was re-engined with NK-25 powerplants each of which
developed 245kN (55,116lb) thrust with afterburning – an increase of more than
25 per cent. The new engines demanded a fuselage redesign, including new
wedge-type air intakes. The result was the definitive Tu-22M3 ‘Backfire-C’.
This model was faster, being capable of a ‘dash’ speed of 2300km/h (1429mph).
It also possessed improved range, including a combat radius of 2200km (1367
miles) when employing a high-profile flight, part of which was flown
supersonic.</p>
            <p>After a first flight in June 1977 the Tu-22M3 entered production, and a total
of 268 examples were completed up to 1993. The final new-build production
version was the Tu-22MR reconnaissance aircraft, around a dozen of which were
manufactured between 1989 and 1993. This is equipped with a side-looking
radar, electronic surveillance measures system, infra-red scanner and cameras.</p>
               <h1>Carrier-Killer</h1>
               <p>The Cold War role of the Tu-22M would have included maritime strike against
high-priority targets such as NATO aircraft carriers and cruise-missile armed
warships in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. Other missions would have
included cutting off Europe from supporting American forces by targeting naval
convoys, harbours and airfields.
The Tu-22M first went to war, however, during the Soviet campaign in
Afghanistan, dropping free-fall bombs from 1984. During the post-Soviet era,Afghanistan, dropping free-fall bombs from 1984. During the post-Soviet era,
Tu-22M3s conducted bombing missions over Chechnya during 1994–96. The
Tu-22M3 returned to battle over Georgia in August 2008 and suffered its first
combat loss when one bomber was downed by a Georgian anti-aircraft missile,
with the loss of three crew.</p>
