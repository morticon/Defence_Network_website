			<p>USS Kitty Hawk, was decommissioned in the same year. After
serving thirteen years with the navy’s only forward-deployed
carrier strike group based at Yokosuka, Japan, Kitty Hawk was
replaced by USS George Washington in 2008, and in turn the
USS Ronald Reagan was slated to relieve the George Washington
at Yokosuka in 2014.
The Nimitz-class carriers are engineering marvels.
Designed for estimated service lives of fifty years, their two
nuclear reactors are expected to require only one refueling—
during the respective carriers’ midlife complex overhauls at
Newport News. The height of a Nimitz carrier is 244 feet from
keel to mast, the equivalent of a twenty-four-story building.
Each carrier has more than three thousand televisions and
2,500 telephones on board and an air-conditioning capacity of
2,250 tons—enough to cool more than five hundred homes.
The shipboard hospital is equipped with state-of-the-art
medical equipment and fifty-three beds with six medical
doctors, a host of nursing personnel, and five dentists. When
deployed, the carriers transport enough dried and refrigerated
food to feed six thousand people for seventy days. Each year</p>

aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan. Constructed by Northrop Grumman at Newport News,
Virginia, the Ronald Reagan was launched in March 2001 and commissioned in July 2003. In
2014, the carrier was slated to relieve the USS George Washington in forward deployment with
the Seventh Fleet carrier strike group based at Yokosuka, Japan. The Ronald Reagan previously
deployed during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. US Navy photo

aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, the first carrier constructed by the welding of
modular sections, leading a sub-class with minor structural alterations and better protection
for ordnance storage areas. Commissioned on October 25, 1986, the Theodore Roosevelt
deployed during the Gulf War and Operation Enduring Freedom. Department of Defense photo
Below: Sailors dressed in winter clothing clear snow from the flight deck of the USS
Nimitz, the lead ship of ten nuclear-powered US Navy carriers that were constructed with
an expected service life of fifty years or more. The Nimitz was launched in May 1972 and
commissioned in 1975. The Nimitz-class carriers are required to refuel only once, during
complex overhauls approximately twenty-five years after entering service. US Navy photo</p>
            <p>After a first flight in June 1977 the Tu-22M3 entered production, and a total
of 268 examples were completed up to 1993. The final new-build production
version was the Tu-22MR reconnaissance aircraft, around a dozen of which were
manufactured between 1989 and 1993. This is equipped with a side-looking
radar, electronic surveillance measures system, infra-red scanner and cameras.</p>
               <h1>Multi-Role</h1>
               <p>The three Nimitz carrier sub-classes are distinguishable
by outwardly subtle design and equipment changes.
Commissioned in 1986, the Theodore Roosevelt was the first
carrier constructed by the welding of modular sections,
leading a sub-class with minor structural alterations and better
protection for ordnance storage areas. With the Ronald Reagan
and George H. W. Bush, the two carriers of the Ronald Reagansubclass, certain cost-saving and innovative design elements
are common, including a reconfigured island. The George H. W.
Bush was completed with some features of the coming Gerald
R. Ford class, including upgrades to radar and other electronic
and environmental equipment, a bulbous bow design, and
improved propellers. While the majority of the Nimitz-class
carriers have been completed for an approximate cost of
$4.5 billion, the final price tag for the George H. W. Bush was
roughly $6.2 billion.</p>
