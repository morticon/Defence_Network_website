			<h1>Stuxnet</h1>
			<p>Stuxnet’s zero-day exploits raised a lot of troubling questions about the
burgeoning role of governments in the secret sale and use of such
exploits—questions that have yet to be considered by Congress or
resolved in public debate, despite evidence that the practice is creating
dangerous vulnerabilities for corporations, critical infrastructure, and
individual computer users alike.</p>
            <h1>Why was stuxnet created?</h1>
            <p>One of the first hints of the free-market commercialization of zero
days appeared in December 2005, when a seller named “fearwall” posted
a zero-day vulnerability for sale on eBay and sparked fears that
legitimate security researchers and bug hunters would soon go the way
of mercenaries and sell their skills and wares to the highest bidder
instead of handing information about software holes over to vendors to
be fixed. Before putting his Windows Excel zero day on the auction
block, fearwall did disclose information about the vulnerability to
Microsoft, as “responsible” researchers were expected to do, but the
software giant was noncommittal about fixing it, and Microsoft didn’t
have a bounty program at the time that paid researchers for the bugs
they disclosed. So fearwall decided to offer his bug to the open market to
embarrass the software giant and force it to fix the hole faster. The
bidding reached only $60 before eBay yanked the listing.
</p>
            <p>The thriving underground black market that caters to crooks and
corporate spies sells not just zero-day vulnerabilities and exploits but
also the payloads to weaponize the exploits—Trojan horses, spy kits, and
other malicious tools designed to steal online banking credentials and
company secrets or amass armies of zombie computers for a botnet.
Vulnerabilities sold on this market become known to the public and
vendors only after attacks that use them are discovered, something that
can take years to occur, as evidenced by the length of time it took
researchers to discover the .LNK exploit that Stuxnet, and the Zlob
Trojan before it, used.</p>
               <h1>Who created stuxnet</h1>
               <p>The US govt and the mosad jointly developed the virus.The documents he revealed provided a virtal window into the NSA 
and its international intelligence partners'secret mass surveillance programs
and capabilities.These revelations generated unprecedented attention around the world 
on privacy intrusions and digital security,leading to a global debate on the issue.

Snowden worked in various roles within the US Intelligence Community,including serving
undercover for the CIA overseas.He most recently worked as an infrastructure analyst
at the NSA,through a Booz Allen Hamilton contract,when
he left his home and family in Hawaii to blow the whistle in May 2013.After travelling
to Hong Kong,Snowden revealed documents to the American public on the NSA's mass surveillance programs,
which were shown to be operating without any public oversight and outside the limits
of the US constitution.The US goverment has changed Snowden with theft 
of gevernment property,and two further charges under the 1917 Espionage Act.Each charge 
carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence.
With the US pursuing his extradition,Snowden is now in Russia,where he was formally
granted three years'residency from 1 August 2014,after a year of temporary asylum in Russia
ended on 31st July 2014.Journalists continue to publish documents from Snowden that
reveal the secret and unaccountable systems of modern global survillance. </p>
