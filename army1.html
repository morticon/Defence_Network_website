			<h1>Sopwith Camel</h1>
			<p>Apparently (and unofficially) named in recognition of the distinctive ‘hump’
               over the breeches for its twin Vickers machine guns, the Herbert Smith-designed
               Sopwith Camel appeared in prototype form in December 1916, powered by a
               Clerget engine. Originally designated as the Biplane F.1, the fighter was
               schemed with equal dihedral (the upward angle given to the wing) on both upper
               and lower wings, but this was abandoned in a bid to ease manufacture. Instead,
               the aircraft featured a flat upper wing, while the dihedral on the lower wing was
               doubled. The result was a characteristic ‘tapered gap’ between the wings.</p>
               <p>Unlike the Sopwith Pup and<em> Triplane</em> that preceded it, the Camel was notablytricky to fly. 
               	It was blessed with power in abundance and its agility was manifest
                in a very tight turning circle. Schemed as a more agile successor to the Pup, the
                Camel was also more powerful and somewhat heavier.</p>
            <h1>Maiden Flight</h1>
            <p>The first prototype F.1, ordered by the Admiralty, completed its maiden flight in
               February 1917 and was followed by two more development airframes with
               different engines. Initial Camel deliveries were to the Royal Naval Air Service
               (RNAS) in May 1917. The first Camels into action, albeit without claiming any
               kills, were RNAS examples stationed at Dunkirk, which scrambled to intercept a
               formation of German Gotha bombers after the latter had raided the coastal town
               of Harwich, Essex, in July 1917. In the same month the Camel began to be
               delivered to the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), equipping No.70 and No.45
               Squadrons that month. July saw the Battle of Ypres, in which RFC Camels were
                involved. By the end of 1917 no fewer than 1325 F.1 Camels had been accepted
                into service.</p>
            <p>The majority of aircraft were delivered with Clerget, Le Rhône, Gnome or
               Bentley radial engines. Production continued after the end of World War I, and
               ultimately over 5000 examples were built by nine different contractors.
               As well as their service on the Western Front, Camels saw action on the
               Home Front with RFC night-fighting units, in Italy, in the Adriatic and Aegean
               with the RNAS. American-flown Camels served with the 17th Aero Squadron of
               the U.S. Army Air Service in France, albeit mainly demoted to training duties.
               Equipped for the night-fighting role, Camels of the Home Defence Squadrons
               featured a revised cockpit mounted further aft and twin Lewis guns replacing the
               Vickers weapons. It was in this role that a Camel achieved the first recorded
               fighter victory over an aircraft at night, downing a Gotha bomber over London in
               January 1918. Some Camels were also used for ground-attack work, notably at
               the Battle of Cambrai in March 1918. Indeed, a specialist ground-attack version
               was developed, as the T.F.1 (Trench Fighter), equipped with downward-firing
               machine guns, but this did not enter production.By the end of the conflict, Camels had been credited with downing a greater
               number of enemy aircraft than any other fighter, the figure – based on official
               records – exceeding 3000. Contributing to this impressive tally was one
               remarkable individual aircraft, B6313, flown by Canadian RFC pilot William
              ‘Billy’ Barker. The pilot retained this same aircraft as he progressed through the ranks of different squadrons in France and Italy, and 
               even when assigned to a Bristol Fighter squadron. In this time, the combination of Barker and his B6313
               accounted for a total of 48 enemy aircraft destroyed – likely to be the highest
               tally of any single aircraft. Following the war, Camels served with the Royal Air
               Force in Archangel, Russia, as part of the Slavo-British Aviation Group, which
               included the ace Alexander Kazakov, who had been most successful Russian
               flying ace of World War I.</p>
               <h1>Camels at sea</h1>
               <p>With the aim of providing aircraft for launch from light cruisers, Sopwith
                  developed a naval version of the Camel. The prototype for the navalized
                  Camel, the FS.1, was equipped with jettisonable wheeled undercarriage for
                  launch, and floats for landing. The wings were shortened and the rear
                  fuselage could be folded for stowage within a warship. From summer 1917
                  the Camel began to be flown off the decks of warships, now under the
                  revised designation 2F.1. Beginning the following year, the Clergetpowered
                  aircraft were deployed aboard Royal Navy battleships. In July
                  1918, seven bomb-armed Camels flying from the deck of HMS Furious
                  attacked the Zeppelin sheds at Tondern, destroying L.54 and L.60.
                  However, only two of the Camels returned safely to the ship. Another
                  maritime use of the Camel involved taking off on skids or wheels from
                  towed lighters. This method was used to good effect in August 1918, when
                  a lighter-launched Camel downed the Zeppelin L.53 over the North Sea –
                   this was the last German airship claimed in the war. Other naval Camels
                  were used in experiments to provide airships with fighter protection, the
                  fighters being released from R.23 using a trapeze mechanism.</p>
