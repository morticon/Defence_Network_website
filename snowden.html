			<h1>Edward Snowden</h1>
			<p>In 2013 the washington Post revealed the existence of a secret act called the prism program.This information
was leaked by militarization,who was a private contractor for Booz Allen Hamilton.This leak was a massive
shock in the U.S and aroung the world.Booz Allen compiled slides detailing how the National Security Agency(NSA)
body got direct access to tech servers and pulled out information.
Big tech and internet firms such as Microsoft,Apple,Verizon,Yahoo,AT&T,Google,etc.cooperate with the NSA by giving
direct access to their servers.
However,the PRISM program's purpose was not well defined due to the Tech and Internet corporation's constant 
denial and contradictions.That has led to the confusion of so many individuals and organizations that really cared
about privacy.</p>
            <h1>Why was Prism created?</h1>
            <p>PRISM act of 2007 is an electronic data collection that aims at protecting the USA according to the NSA.It 
was a top-secret and advanced surveillance program of the NSA.The PRISM program had a code-name US-984XN.
According to the leak presentation,the NSA claimed that it launched the program to overcome the FISA warrant's
pitfalls.The FISA warrant is in charge of tracking down and prosecuting foreign terrorists.But court mandates
were needed before they can access and investigate the information of suspected criminals.The NSA wanted to overcome 
this challenge and have the flexibility of tracking downanyone when the body wants.Furthermore,the NSA noted
that the USA has advantages in tracking down terrorists because most of the big tech companies reside in USA.
</p>
            <p>The PRISM program activities are shrouded in secrecy,which is not also helped by the constant denial of tech
companies.But what the data suggest from leaked documents,the PRISM program relies on two aspects for its 
mass data collection.
*Section 702 of Foreign Intelligence Survillance Act(FISA)
*Section 215 of the US's Patriot Act.
    The Prism program law authorizes security agencies to retreive communications and metadata from telecommunication
companies like AT&T,Verizon,Google,Yahoo,Facebook and other telecommunication and internet companies.</p>
               <h1>Who is responsible for leaking PRISM?</h1>
               <p>Edward Snowden is a 31 year old us citizen,former intelligence community officer
and whistleblower.The documents he revealed provided a virtal window into the NSA 
and its international intelligence partners'secret mass surveillance programs
and capabilities.These revelations generated unprecedented attention around the world 
on privacy intrusions and digital security,leading to a global debate on the issue.

Snowden worked in various roles within the US Intelligence Community,including serving
undercover for the CIA overseas.He most recently worked as an infrastructure analyst
at the NSA,through a Booz Allen Hamilton contract,when
he left his home and family in Hawaii to blow the whistle in May 2013.After travelling
to Hong Kong,Snowden revealed documents to the American public on the NSA's mass surveillance programs,
which were shown to be operating without any public oversight and outside the limits
of the US constitution.The US goverment has changed Snowden with theft 
of gevernment property,and two further charges under the 1917 Espionage Act.Each charge 
carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence.
With the US pursuing his extradition,Snowden is now in Russia,where he was formally
granted three years'residency from 1 August 2014,after a year of temporary asylum in Russia
ended on 31st July 2014.Journalists continue to publish documents from Snowden that
reveal the secret and unaccountable systems of modern global survillance. </p>
