			<h1>F-22</h1>
			<p>The Raptor is described by its operator as representing ‘an exponential leap in
warfighting capabilities’. The F-22A began life as the Advanced Tactical Fighter
(ATF) programme which entered the demonstration and validation phase in
1986. The U.S. Air Force lined up seven companies as contenders for the ATF
program, with Lockheed and Northrop as the primary airframe contractors.
Lockheed teamed up with Boeing and General Dynamics, while Northrop’s
effort was joined by principle contractor McDonnell Douglas. The resulting YF 22 and YF-23 prototypes were built for a fly-off competition, which also
involved rival engines from Pratt & Whitney and General Electric (the YF119
and YF120, respectively). The YF-22 made its first flight in September 1990.</p>
               <p>The USAF selected the YF-22 and YF119 as the most promising and
launched the engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase in 1991.
Development contracts were issued to Lockheed/Boeing (airframe) and Pratt &
Whitney (engines). EMD included extensive tests of systems and subsystems as
well as flight testing with nine aircraft at Edwards Air Force Base, California. A
first EMD flight was recorded 1997.</p>
            <h1>Maiden Flight</h1>
            <p>In 2001 the programme received approval to enter low-rate initial
production. There followed initial operational and test evaluation by the Air
Force Operational Test and Evaluation Centre, which was successfully
concluded in 2004. Approval for full-rate production was granted in 2005.
After briefly receiving the F/A-22 designation in recognition of its attack
capabilities, the Raptor was renamed as the F-22A in December 2005; at the
same time the aircraft achieved initial operational capability with the USAF’s
27th Fighter Squadron. At one time, the USAF planned to procure a minimum of
750 ATFs, but the end of the Cold War saw this dramatically scaled back, and
finally just 187 aircraft were acquired at a unit cost of $143 million.</p>
            <p>The Raptor’s prowess in the air-to-air arena is ensured through a
combination of sensor capability, integrated avionics, situational awareness and
weaponry. Combined with its stealth characteristics and performance, the sensor
suite is intended to permit the F-22 pilot to track, identify, engage and kill air-toair
threats before being detected. Primary sensors are the AN/APG-77 active
electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and AN/ALR-94 passive receiver
system. A high degree of situational awareness is ensured through advanced
cockpit design and sensor fusion. In typical air-to-air configuration the Raptor is
armed with six AIM-120C AMRAAMs and two AIM-9M Sidewinder missiles.</p>
               <h1>Operators</h1>
               <p>An F-22A of 27th Fighter Squadron (FS), 1st Fighter Wing (FW), the
USAF’s first Raptor unit. Air Combat Command includes the 1st FW at
Langley, Virginia, with the 27th and 94th FS, and the 49th FW at
Holloman, New Mexico, with the 7th and 8th FS, the 53rd Wing’s 422nd
Test and Evaluation Squadron at Eglin, Florida, the 57th Wing’s 433rd
Weapons Squadron at Nellis, Nevada, and the 325th FW’s 43rd FS at
Tyndall, Florida. Pacific Air Forces fly the F-22A with the 3rd Wing at
Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, comprising the 90th and 525th FS. Raptors
are also operated by Air National Guard wings at Langley and Hickam, and
by two Air Force Reserve Command fighter groups at Holloman. Finally,
Air Force Materiel Command includes the 412th Test Wing’s 411th Flight
Test Squadron at at Edwards, California.</p>
